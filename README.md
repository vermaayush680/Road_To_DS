# Road To Being A Data 

### This repository is to record my progress and journey to being a Data Scientist.

### One of the most sought after skills as a Data Scientist is SQL so that is where my journey starts.

#### A little background of me:
* I am currently a final year student
* I have recently finished a Data Science Internship have basic knowledge of ML and DS but not a lot.
* I have average DSA skills so while maintaining those skills, I am trying to upscale in other aspects of Data Science.

#### Here is the DSA plan I followed for about 30 days : [DSA](https://github.com/vermaayush680/LeetCode-LinkedIn)

## **Approach:**

I will be following the SQL Plan of Leet Code : [LeetCode SQL Plan](https://leetcode.com/study-plan/sql/) and posting one solution everyday on LinkedIn as well on Github.
